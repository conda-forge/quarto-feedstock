Remove QUARTO_VERSION assignment for build-time patching with a dynamic value

See `bld.bat` and `build.sh` for the build-time patch. The comment in this
patch explains why we couldn't simply patch in an assignment like `export
QUARTO_VERSION=${PKG_VERSION}`.

TODO: Propose this comment change to upstream.
